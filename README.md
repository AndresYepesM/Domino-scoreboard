# Domino-scoreboard
a domino scoreboard made using javascript and bootstrap(CSS and HTML)

One day i was playing with my family domino, and i saw my father write it down the score on paper and pencil, and i said, there is not a domino scoreboard?, and the answer in that moment was no, i'm still learning about javascript and this was a really good opportunity to test to my new knowledge, i know is not the most efficient code i ever write but it work lol, thats why im uploading this code on github just to have a memory or a checkpoint of my journey learning javascript :)

the page is really simple to understand: 

First, this is the way how my family play domino; We set four players each team have two players, someone of the four players mix the chips and the next to the right start picking up his own chips after that, rest of the players, and the game begin, the first player to get out of chips won the turn, him and his partner and the other team show his chips and we sum each point on the chip with thats we set the end of the first turn, and this for all the game until one team reach one hundred or more points


the Scoreboard show the total points and the points each team get on each turn, if one of the teams reach the max point that is 100 the winner team will be show as color green and the loser team as color red, like i said is easy to understand the page and i hope you and your family start playing domino and have fun using this scoreboard :)
